This repo has the source for different twitter bots I've built on http://cheapbotsdonequick.com.

Each `.json` corresponds to a different twitter account, matching the filename. The files are written using the grammar of https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery.

If you'd like to host one of these bots on your own, you can using https://github.com/v21/tracerybot.
