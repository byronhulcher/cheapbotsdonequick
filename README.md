This repo has the source for different twitter bots I've built on http://cheapbotsdonequick.com. You can host your own copy of the site using https://github.com/v21/tracerybot as well.

Each `.json` corresponds to a different twitter account, matching the filename. The files are written using the grammar of https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery.
